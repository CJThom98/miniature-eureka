# Note Taker Starter Code

## Developer Complaints
- Front end code given to the developer was incomplete. Notes.html and it's CSS did not match the mock up provided when tested on the local machine. This was a back end project, I'm here to develop, test, and run your server, not clean up your front end teams mess. It's impossible for me to know if the final product matches the client's desire when half of the product is incomplete.
