# Note Taker Starter Code

## Notes
- For the most part, developing the server for this website was fairly easy
- The initial tests were successful and I had an MVP 
- The problems came to the end and I became dead locked. 
- Attempting to figure out how to ensure new notes were added was hiddered by a seemingly incomplete css for notes.html
- Even running the html file through the local machine it didn't match the mock up remotely, the body looked very different
